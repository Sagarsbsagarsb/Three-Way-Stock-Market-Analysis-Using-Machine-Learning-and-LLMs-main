# Three-Way-Stock-Market-Analysis-Using-Machine-Learning-and-LLMs-main
Three-Way Stock Market Analysis using Machine Learning and LLMs – A project that combines deep learning (LSTM) for stock trend prediction, NLP-based sentiment analysis, and LLM-powered explanation generation with RAG to provide comprehensive insights into stock movements.
# 📈 Three-Way Stock Market Analysis Using Machine Learning and LLMs

This project integrates **deep learning, sentiment analysis, and large language models (LLMs)** to provide a holistic view of stock market trends. By combining **time-series forecasting (LSTM), sentiment analysis of financial news, and LLM-driven explanation generation**, the system delivers actionable insights for investors and researchers.

## 🚀 Project Modules

### 1️⃣ Stock Trend Prediction (LSTM)
- Uses historical stock price data.
- Performs preprocessing (scaling, windowing, splitting).
- Implements **LSTM neural network** for next-day/next-period price prediction.
- Visualizes actual vs predicted trends.

### 2️⃣ Sentiment Analysis (NLP)
- Analyzes **financial news headlines / tweets**.
- Uses **FinBERT / VADER** models for sentiment classification (Positive, Neutral, Negative).
- Aggregates sentiment to reflect market mood.

### 3️⃣ Explanation Generation (LLM + RAG)
- Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with **Large Language Models**.
- Generates **human-readable insights** explaining stock movements.
- Answers user queries about **why** a stock is going up/down.
